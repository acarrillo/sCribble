WHAT ARE YOU?
    I am a collaborative doodle-pad. Combining the simplicity of MS Paint with the magic of networking, we can bring multiple clients together to work on a single screen.

HOW DO I USE YOU?
    Quite simply, just draw on the canvas and all of your edits will simultaneously propagate to all of your collaborators’ canvases as well.  To create a new doodle, use the interface just like you would make any other file on your computer. You will be presented with a special code that other users can use to “log in” to your doodle.

HOW DO YOU WORK?

    Each "doodle" will be hosted by a central server (which runs alongside one client program).  The server/client distinction will not be transparent to the user and the “code” generated for each doodle will be a description of the server’s location on the network.
    Changes made to the doodle will be sent as high-level instructions ("draw a red line of width 5px from 1,2 to 3,4").  Specialized structs will hold this data.  Each client will be split up into at least three processes: one is a "canvas" that is dedicated entirely to drawing the instructions sent to it, another is the user interactions process that intercepts mouse events to send to the canvas and central server, and the last is a networking client that sends instructions from the central server to the canvas.

    sample struct outline:
    {
        timestamp;
        tool type;
        color;
        size;
        tool-specific data; //e.g. x,y coordinates
    }
